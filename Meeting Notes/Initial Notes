# Initial Ideas

## Questions/Objectives
Measure at what point transport becomes viable to the public
	- timeliness
	- cleanlinees
	
Comparison between low usage rates and high usage rates
	How long before US transport becomes viable?
	Comparison of networks between similar sized and *sprawled* cities and how that can be implemented
	
How can we optimize transnational shipping routes
	- routes in the arctic
	- impact of storms
	- cost of delays
	- seasonal optimization of routes
	

## Stats methods we want to explore
- Deep Learning
	- Image analysis suboptimal -> optimal. Where to best place stops?
- Time series -> Talk to Dr. Lee


# TODO
- Talk to Dr. Lee re Time series and deep learning
- Get a bunch of data into one forlder to discuss
